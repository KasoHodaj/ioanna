Website Information:

This website was created by Kaso Hodaj (Me :D) as a personal project to help Ioanna showcase her skills and achievements. The website was designed with a focus on user experience (UX) and 
features responsive design to ensure optimal viewing across various devices. The following skills and tools were utilized in the creation of this website:

    HTML & CSS for structuring and styling
    UX Design principles for intuitive navigation and user interaction
    Responsive Design techniques to ensure compatibility with different screen sizes
    Challenges faced: As this was my first real-life portfolio project, I encountered challenges in balancing design aesthetics with functionality and ensuring smooth navigation. 
    However, overcoming these challenges has provided valuable learning experiences and growth in my skills as a web developer.
